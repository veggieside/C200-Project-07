# Project Name

MSCH-C220 Final Project

One Man Band

## Theme

A game I thought of with just one button/click was Rhythm Heaven, so I decided to go that route and make a rhythm game.

## Game Play

Time your button presses correctly to the beat of the song, indicated by a three-colored circle that measures how accurate your time is.

## What did you

I think the hardest part was figuring out how to have my white hit-circle correctly respond to which area of color it was in.

## Implementation

All artwork created by me

One button gameplay

Audio

Animation

User interfaces

Gameplay level

## Special Focus

My special focus was in art, so I created all of my sprites myself and worked to design a new character for this game and tried to tie it together with my game's overall aesthetic theme. I would rate my effort in my area of focus a 5, as this is the most time I've put into making art for an assignment in this class.

## Future Development

Adjusting the rhythm mechanic to have more variety, maybe held notes, etc. Making actual animations for the sprites rather than tweens.
